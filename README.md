## About Me

I'm a software developer based in Croatia who likes hacking on a wide range of
software. I'm drawn to writing code more so than working on any specific thing.

I'm interested in game (engine) development, procedural content generation,
systems programming, abstraction and metaprogramming, programming language
development.

I love both highly dynamic and abstract languages and low level ones, each for
their different quirks and charms. Started off at the age of 10 in dynamic and
over time shifted towards compile time of low level ones - in other words I take
no issue in tanking your compilation times Gentoo users üòè

Due to the nature of my work, at any given time, I have at least 3 different WMs
installed as well as 500 other packages I don't need or use.

In my free time I contribute to random FOSS projects (mostly conky), watch a lot
of TV Shows and Anime, sometimes touch grass, and read technical books and
papers.

I use Arch btw. I've tried other distros ranging from Ubuntu to Void, and Arch
hits the sweet spot for me.
